Here's a workflow and brief for the AR measurement tool:
Project Title: AR Measurement Tool
Objective:
Create an Augmented Reality (AR) measurement tool that allows users to measure objects in 3D space using their mobile device. The tool should capture a photo of the object and provide accurate measurements.
Workflow:
Scene Setup:
User opens the AR measurement tool on their mobile device.
The tool detects the environment and sets up a 3D scene.
Object Detection:
User points their device's camera at the object they want to measure.
The tool uses raycasting to detect the object and calculate its dimensions.
Measurement Calculation:
The tool calculates the dimensions of the object (width, height, depth).
The measurements are displayed on the screen.
Photo Capture:
User captures a photo of the object.
The tool stores the image data and measurement information.
Data Transmission:
The tool sends the image data and measurement information to a server for further processing.
Results:
The server processes the data and returns the results to the user.
Brief:
Functional Requirements:
AR Scene Setup: Set up a 3D scene using A-Frame.
Object Detection: Use raycasting to detect objects in the scene.
Measurement Calculation: Calculate the dimensions of the object (width, height, depth).
Photo Capture: Capture a photo of the object and store image data.
Data Transmission: Send image data and measurement information to a server.
Results Display: Display the measurement results to the user.
Non-Functional Requirements:
Accuracy: Ensure accurate measurements of objects.
Performance: Optimize the tool for smooth performance on mobile devices.
User Experience: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
Deliverables:
AR Measurement Tool: A functional AR measurement tool that captures photos and provides accurate measurements.
Server-Side Processing: A server-side solution to process image data and measurement information.
Documentation: Documentation of the tool's functionality and usage.
Timeline:
The project timeline will depend on the complexity of the requirements and the development team's experience. A rough estimate for the project timeline is 4-6 weeks.
Resources:
A-Frame: An open-source framework for building AR/VR experiences.
Three.js: A JavaScript library for 3D rendering.
Server-Side Technology: A server-side technology such as Node.js or Python to process image data and measurement information.
